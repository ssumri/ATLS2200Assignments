      A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera
      indica. It is believed to have originated in southern Asia, particularly
      in eastern India, Bangladesh, and the Andaman Islands.[1] M. indica has
      been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting
      in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the
      "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also
      produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of
      which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[4] Worldwide, there are several
      hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies
      in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale
      yellow, gold, green, or orange.[1] Mango is the national fruit of India,
      Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national
      tree of Bangladesh.[7]

    <h4 id="Etymology">Etymology</h4>
    <p>
      The English word mango (plural "mangoes" or "mangos") originated in the
      16th century from the Portuguese word manga, from the Malay mangga, and
      ultimately from the Tamil man ("mango tree") + kay ("fruit").[8][9] The
      scientific name, Mangifera indica, refers to a plant bearing mangoes in
      India.[9]
    </p>
    <h4 id="Description">Description</h4>
    <p>
      Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius
      of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are long-lived, as some specimens still
      fruit after 300 years.[10] <br />

      In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with
      profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply
      into the soil.[1] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35
      centimetres (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when
      the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark,
      glossy red, then dark green as they mature.[1] The flowers are produced in
      terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and
      white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild,
      sweet fragrance.[1] Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known,[1] many of
      which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.[11] The fruit takes
      four to five months from flowering to ripening.[1]<br />

      The ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size, shape, color,
      sweetness, and eating quality.[1] Depending on the cultivar, fruits are
      variously yellow, orange, red, or green.[1] The fruit has a single flat,
      oblong pit that can be fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not
      separate easily from the pulp.[1] The fruits may be somewhat round, oval,
      or kidney-shaped, ranging from 5–25 centimetres (2–10 in) in length and
      from 140 grams (5 oz) to 2 kilograms (5 lb) in weight per individual
      fruit.[1] The skin is leather-like, waxy, smooth, and fragrant, with
      colors ranging from green to yellow, yellow-orange, yellow-red, or blushed
      with various shades of red, purple, pink, or yellow when fully ripe.[1]<br />

      Ripe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell.[1]
      Inside the pit 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) thick is a thin lining covering a
      single seed, 4–7 cm (1.6–2.8 in) long. Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds
      which do not survive freezing and drying.[12] Mango trees grow readily
      from seeds, with germination success highest when seeds are obtained from
      mature fruits.[1]
    </p>
    <h4 id="Taxonomy">Taxonomy</h4>
    <p>
      Mangoes originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar,
      Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[2][3] The mango is considered an
      evolutionary anachronism, whereby seed dispersal was once accomplished by
      a now-extinct evolutionary forager, such as a megafauna mammal.[13] <br />

      From their center of origin, mangoes diverged into two genetically
      distinct populations: the subtropical Indian group and the tropical
      Southeast Asian group. The Indian group is characterized by having
      monoembryonic fruits, while polyembryonic fruits characterize the
      Southeast Asian group.[2][3] <br />

      It was previously believed that mangoes originated from a single
      domestication event in South Asia before being spread to Southeast Asia,
      but a 2019 study found no evidence of a center of diversity in India.
      Instead, it identified a higher unique genetic diversity in Southeast
      Asian cultivars than in Indian cultivars, indicating that mangoes may have
      originally been domesticated first in Southeast Asia before being
      introduced to South Asia. However, the authors also cautioned that the
      diversity in Southeast Asian mangoes might be the result of other reasons
      (like interspecific hybridization with other Mangifera species native to
      the Malesian ecoregion). Nevertheless, the existence of two distinct
      genetic populations also identified by the study indicates that the
      domestication of the mango is more complex than previously assumed and
      would at least indicate multiple domestication events in Southeast Asia
      and South Asia.[2][3] <br />
    </p>
    <h5 id="Cultivars">Cultivars</h5>
    <p>
      There are many hundreds of named mango cultivars. In mango orchards,
      several cultivars are often grown to improve pollination. Many desired
      cultivars are monoembryonic and must be propagated by grafting, or they do
      not breed true. A common monoembryonic cultivar is 'Alphonso', an
      important export product, considered "the king of mangoes."[14] <br />

      Cultivars that excel in one climate may fail elsewhere. For example,
      Indian cultivars such as 'Julie,' a prolific cultivar in Jamaica, require
      annual fungicide treatments to escape the lethal fungal disease
      anthracnose in Florida. Asian mangoes are resistant to anthracnose.[15]<br />

      The current world market is dominated by the cultivar 'Tommy Atkins', a
      seedling of 'Haden' that first fruited in 1940 in southern Florida and was
      initially rejected commercially by Florida researchers.[16] Growers and
      importers worldwide have embraced the cultivar for its excellent
      productivity and disease resistance, shelf life, transportability, size,
      and appealing color.[17] Although the Tommy Atkins cultivar is
      commercially successful, other cultivars may be preferred by consumers for
      eating pleasure, such as Alphonso.[14][17] <br />

      Generally, ripe mangoes have an orange-yellow or reddish peel and are
      juicy for eating, while exported fruit are often picked while underripe
      with green peels. Although producing ethylene while ripening, unripened
      exported mangoes do not have the same juiciness or flavor as fresh fruit.
      <br />

    <h4 id="Distribution">Distribution and habitat</h4>
    <p>
      From tropical Asia, mangoes were introduced to East Africa by Arab and
      Persian traders in the ninth to tenth centuries.[18] The 14th-century
      Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta reported it at Mogadishu.[19] It was spread
      further into other areas around the world during the Colonial Era. The
      Portuguese Empire spread the mango from their colony in Goa to East and
      West Africa. From West Africa, they introduced it to Brazil from the 16th
      to the 17th centuries. From Brazil, it spread northwards to the Caribbean
      and eastern Mexico by the mid to late 18th century. The Spanish Empire
      also introduced mangoes directly from the Philippines to western Mexico
      via the Manila galleons from at least the 16th century. Mangoes were only
      introduced to Florida by 1833.[3][20]
    </p>
    <h4 id="Cultivation">Cultivation</h4>
    <p>
      The mango is now cultivated in most frost-free tropical and warmer
      subtropical climates. It is cultivated extensively in South Asia,
      Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, the tropical and subtropical
      Americas, and the Caribbean.[21] Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia,
      Spain (mainly in Málaga province), as its coastal subtropical climate is
      one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of
      tropical plants and fruit trees. The Canary Islands are another notable
      Spanish producer of the fruit. Other minor cultivators include North
      America (in South Florida and the California Coachella Valley), Hawai'i,
      and Australia.[22] <br />

      Many commercial cultivars are grafted onto the cold-hardy rootstock of the
      Gomera-1 mango cultivar, originally from Cuba. Its root system is well
      adapted to a coastal Mediterranean climate.[23] Many of the 1,000+ mango
      cultivars are easily cultivated using grafted saplings, ranging from the
      "turpentine mango" (named for its strong taste of turpentine[24]) to the
      Bullock's Heart. Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants
      and can be grown in containers. A wide variety of diseases can afflict
      mangoes.[citation needed] <br />

      A breakthrough in mango cultivation was the use of potassium nitrate and
      ethrel to induce flowering in mangoes. The discovery was made by Filipino
      horticulturist Ramon Barba in 1974 and was developed from the unique
      traditional method of inducing mango flowering using smoke in the
      Philippines. It allowed mango plantations to induce regular flowering and
      fruiting year-round. Previously, mangoes were seasonal because they only
      flowered every 16 to 18 months. The method is now used in most
      mango-producing countries.[26][27] <br />
    </p>
    <h4 id="Production">Production</h4>
    <p>
      In 2021, world production of mangoes (report includes mangosteens and
      guavas) was 57 million tonnes, led by India with 44% of the total
      (table).[25]

      Mangoes are generally sweet, although the taste and texture of the flesh
      vary across cultivars; some, such as Alphonso, have a soft, pulpy, juicy
      texture similar to an overripe plum, while others, such as Tommy Atkins,
      are firmer with a fibrous texture.[28] <br />

      The skin of unripe, pickled, or cooked mango can be eaten, but it has the
      potential to cause contact dermatitis of the lips, gingiva, or tongue in
      susceptible people.[29] <br />

      Mangoes are used in many cuisines. Sour, unripe mangoes are used in
      chutneys (i.e., mango chutney), pickles, daals and other side dishes in
      Indian cuisine. A summer drink called aam panna is made with mangoes.
      Mango pulp made into jelly or cooked with red gram dhal and green chilies
      may be served with cooked rice. Mango lassi is consumed throughout South
      Asia, prepared by mixing ripe mangoes or mango pulp with buttermilk and
      sugar. Ripe mangoes are also used to make curries. Aamras is a thick juice
      made of mangoes with sugar or milk and is consumed with chapatis or
      pooris. The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called
      mangada. Andhra aavakaaya is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and
      sour mango mixed with chili powder, fenugreek seeds, mustard powder, salt,
      and groundnut oil. Mango is also used to make dahl and chunda (a sweet and
      spicy, grated mango delicacy). <br />

      Mangoes are used to make murabba (fruit preserves), muramba (a sweet,
      grated mango delicacy), amchur (dried and powdered unripe mango), and
      pickles, including a spicy mustard-oil pickle and alcohol. Ripe mangoes
      are cut into thin layers, desiccated, folded and then cut. The fruit is
      also added to cereal products such as muesli and oat granola.<br />

      Mango is used to make juices, smoothies, ice cream, fruit bars, raspados,
      aguas frescas, pies, and sweet chili sauce, or mixed with chamoy, a sweet
      and spicy chili paste. In Central America, mango is either eaten green,
      mixed with salt, vinegar, black pepper, and hot sauce, or ripe in various
      forms.<br />

      Pieces of mango can be mashed and used as a topping on ice cream or
      blended with milk and ice as milkshakes. Sweet glutinous rice is flavored
      with coconut, then served with sliced mango as mango sticky rice. In other
      parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with fish sauce and rice
      vinegar. Green mangoes can be used in mango salad with fish sauce and
      dried shrimp. Mango with condensed milk may be used as a topping for
      shaved ice.<br />

      Raw green mangoes can be sliced and eaten like a salad.[30] In most parts
      of Southeast Asia, they are commonly eaten with fish sauce, vinegar, soy
      sauce, or with a dash of salt (plain or spicy) – a combination usually
      known as "mango salad" in English.[31]<br />

      In the Philippines, green mangoes are also commonly eaten with bagoong
      (salty fish or shrimp paste), salt, soy sauce, vinegar or chilis.[32][33]
      Mango float and mango cake, which use slices of ripe mangoes, are eaten in
      the Philippines.[34][35] Dried strips of sweet, ripe mango (sometimes
      combined with seedless tamarind to form mangorind) are also consumed.
      Mangoes may be used to make juices, mango nectar, and as a flavoring and
      major ingredient in mango ice cream and sorbetes. <br />
    </p>
    <h4 id="Phytochemistry">Phytochemistry</h4>
    <p>
      Numerous phytochemicals are present in mango peel and pulp, such as the
      triterpene lupeol.[36] Mango peel pigments under study include
      carotenoids, such as the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene, lutein and
      alpha-carotene,[37][38] and polyphenols, such as quercetin, kaempferol,
      gallic acid, caffeic acid, catechins and tannins.[39][40] Mango contains a
      unique xanthonoid called mangiferin.[41] <br />

      Phytochemical and nutrient content appears to vary across mango
      cultivars.[42] Up to 25 different carotenoids have been isolated from
      mango pulp, the densest of which was beta-carotene, which accounts for the
      yellow-orange pigmentation of most mango cultivars.[43] Mango leaves also
      have significant polyphenol content, including xanthonoids, mangiferin and
      gallic acid.[44] <br />
    </p>
    <h5 id="Flavor">Flavor</h5>
    <p>
      The flavor of mango fruits is conferred by several volatile organic
      chemicals mainly belonging to terpene, furanone, lactone, and ester
      classes. Different varieties or cultivars of mangoes can have flavors made
      up of different volatile chemicals or the same volatile chemicals in
      different quantities.[45] In general, New World mango cultivars are
      characterized by the dominance of δ-3-carene, a monoterpene flavorant;
      whereas, high concentration of other monoterpenes such as (Z)-ocimene and
      myrcene, as well as the presence of lactones and furanones, is the unique
      feature of Old World cultivars.[46][47][48] In India, 'Alphonso' is one of
      the most popular cultivars. In 'Alphonso' mango, the lactones and
      furanones are synthesized during ripening, whereas terpenes and the other
      flavorants are present in both the developing (immature) and ripening
      fruits.[49][50][51] Ethylene, a ripening-related hormone well known to be
      involved in ripening of mango fruits, causes changes in the flavor
      composition of mango fruits upon exogenous application, as well.[52][53]
      In contrast to the huge amount of information available on the chemical
      composition of mango flavor, the biosynthesis of these chemicals has not
      been studied in depth; only a handful of genes encoding the enzymes of
      flavor biosynthetic pathways have been characterized to
      date.[54][55][56][57]
    </p>
    <h5 id="Toxicity">Toxicity</h5>
    <p>
      Contact with oils in mango leaves, stems, sap, and skin can cause
      dermatitis and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.[1][29][58] Those
      with a history of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol (an allergen
      found in poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac) may be most at risk for
      mango contact dermatitis.[59] Other mango compounds potentially
      responsible for dermatitis or allergic reactions include mangiferin.[1]
      Cross-reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol.[60]
      Sensitized individuals may not be able to eat peeled mangos or drink mango
      juice safely.[1] <br />

      When mango trees are flowering in spring, local people with allergies may
      experience breathing difficulty, itching of the eyes, or facial swelling,
      even before flower pollen becomes airborne.[1] In this case, the irritant
      is likely to be the vaporized essential oil from flowers.[1] During the
      primary ripening season of mangoes, contact with mango plant parts –
      primarily sap, leaves, and fruit skin[1] – is the most common cause of
      plant dermatitis in Hawaii.[61] <br />

      A raw mango is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has
      negligible fat (table). The energy value per 100 g (3.5 oz) serving of raw
      mango is 250 kJ (60 calories). Fresh mango contains only vitamin C and
      folate in significant amounts of the Daily Value as 44% and 11%,
      respectively (table).

      The mango is the national fruit of India.[62][63] It is also the national
      tree of Bangladesh.[64][65] In India, harvest and sale of mangoes is
      during March–May and this is annually covered by news agencies.[14]<br />

      The mango has a traditional context in the culture of South Asia. In his
      edicts, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka references the planting of fruit- and
      shade-bearing trees along imperial roads:<br />

      "On the roads banyan-trees were caused to be planted by me, (in order
      that) they might afford shade to cattle and men, (and) mango-groves were
      caused to be planted." <br />

      In medieval India, the Indo-Persian poet Amir Khusrow termed the mango
      "Naghza Tarin Mewa Hindustan" – "the fairest fruit of Hindustan." Mangoes
      were enjoyed at the court of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khijli. The Mughal
      Empire was especially fond of the fruits: Babur praises the mango in his
      Babarnameh. At the same time, Sher Shah Suri inaugurated the creation of
      the Chaunsa variety after his victory over the Mughal emperor Humayun.
      Mughal patronage of horticulture led to the grafting of thousands of
      mangoes varieties, including the famous Totapuri, which was the first
      variety to be exported to Iran and Central Asia.[citation needed] Akbar
      (1556–1605) is said to have planted a mango orchard of 100,000 trees near
      Darbhanga, Bihar,[66] while Jahangir and Shah Jahan ordered the planting
      of mango orchards in Lahore and Delhi and the creation of mango-based
      desserts.[67] <br />

      The Jain goddess Ambika is traditionally represented as sitting under a
      mango tree.[68] Mango blossoms are also used in the worship of the goddess
      Saraswati. Mango leaves decorate archways and doors in Indian houses
      during weddings and celebrations such as Ganesh Chaturthi. Mango motifs
      and paisleys are widely used in different Indian embroidery styles, and
      are found in Kashmiri shawls, Kanchipuram and silk sarees. In Tamil Nadu,
      the mango is referred to as one of the three royal fruits, along with
      banana and jackfruit, for their sweetness and flavor.[69] This triad of
      fruits is referred to as ma-pala-vazhai. The classical Sanskrit poet
      Kālidāsa sang the praises of mangoes.[70] <br />

      Mangoes were the subject of the mango cult in China during the Cultural
      Revolution as symbols of chairman Mao Zedong's love for the people.[71]
