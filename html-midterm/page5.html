      <h3>Page 1 changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Line 44: I was getting an error because the tr tag was opened and
          never closed. I added end tag for tr inside table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 45: I was getting an error because the table tag was opened and
          never closed. I added end tag for table.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 2: Language was not specified in the html tag. I added lang="en"
          to the html tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 30: The image tag's source was not valid since that image did not
          exist. I changed the src element to contain a relative path to an
          existing image.
        </li>
        <li>Line 1: No meta tags on this link. I have added them.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Page 2 changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Line 27: Empty tag that should contain the end tag for the bold tag. I
          added '/'b into the empty tag to get rid of the error and only bolden
          the text that says "New Beehive Inn"
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 31-36: The end paragraph tag on line 31 was giving an error
          because it could not find the starting pair for that tag. I fixed this
          by indenting lines 31-36 appropriately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 53: The h2 tag cannot be inside the bold tags because the tag
          itself cannot be boldened. I fixed this issue by rearranging the
          nested tags to contain the bold tags inside the h2 tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 57: The href element on the anchor tag had text instead of a
          valid link/path. Since the source to this page is provided in the
          navbar, I used the wikipedia link to get what the original text linked
          to and used an absolute path to link the text to the appropriate
          wikipedia page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 74: The h6 tag was never closed when titiling this section and
          thus the program thinks i am trying to add an hr tag inside the h6
          tag. I added the ending tag so the error would cease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Structure: The sections of this page are not following a single method
          and is ranging from h2 to h6. I will add the horizontal line to be
          before the h2 section titles on all sections to make the page more
          cohesive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 24: The title is wrong for this page. The linked wikipedia is
          titled the New Beehive Inn so I have changed the name accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 52: The href to "bay" was a broken link. I linked the appropriate
          wikipedia link.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Page 3 changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Line 4: As the comment states, the page is missing all of the title,
          meta and a link to the stylesheet. I have added all of these
          acordingly. Also added the language element to the html.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 1: Doctype was not specified as HTML. I added that line at the
          top of the file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logic: Footer is not anchored at the bottom of the page. I fixed this
          in the css code by setting the footer position to be relative.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Page 4 changes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Line 1: Doctype was not specified as HTML. I added that line at the
          top of the file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Line 37-39, 42-44, 47-49: image tags do not have an alt element. i
          added all of the alt elements after looking at the images.
        </li>
        <li>Line 43, 48: added the td tags to the images</li>
        <li>
          Logic: fixed the table so that the column headings align with the
          cooresponding images.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
